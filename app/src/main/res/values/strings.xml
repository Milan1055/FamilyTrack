    <string name="about_text">According to Rachel Krishna (2020) 75,918 children were recorded
        missing by the UK police forces in 2018/2019, and only 52% of the incidents were
        resolved within 8 hours.
        This is the main reason why I created this application as my Final Year Project, which may help the authorities
        to reduce the time being taken to resolve these cases, and find lost children to allow them to reunite with their family as soon as possible.
